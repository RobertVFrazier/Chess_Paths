<h1>Chess Paths is a simple puzzle game I'm writing for my Node capstone project for Thinkful.</h1>

The inital, minimum viable product version has a single puzzle in which you place a chess 
queen on an empty chess board and try to move over and/or land on every square on the board
in just 14 moves. 

<h2>Features complete now:</h2>

Splash page, information page, game page, rules page, how the queen moves page.

Game board on which you try to solve the puzzle. Every square is a button. Click a square to
place the queen, then click other squares to make moves.

Scoreboard which keeps track of how many moves you have made and how many squares 
have been visited.

Undo, redo, and reset buttons. Full undo back to before placing the queen on the board, full 
redo to the end of the game (if you made it that far).

Save/load game, with sign up/log in for users to keep their games separate from those others have 
saved. This is where the back-end database comes in.

<h2>Features partially complete:</h2>

Responsive design. Working at least acceptably well for all phones, needs more work for tablets
and computer screens.

Display of moves on the chess board. The squares which have been visited are colored with a 
semi-transparent gold overlay, but the paths made by each move are not yet being drawn. (Paths
is right there in the name of the app, so that needs to happen.)

<h2>MVP features not done:</h2>

Keyboard controls for those not using the mouse.

<h2>Stretch goals:</h2>

Animation to make everything look better!

Music and sound effects.

Option to display all legal moves during the game, for those still learning how the queen moves.

Additional puzzles for the knight, bishop, and rook.

Second queen puzzle.
